# lein-lessjs

Leiningen plugin to compile LESS files with
[Less.js](http://lesscss.org/).

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/lein-lessjs/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/lein-lessjs)


## Installation

You can install the plugin by adding lein-lessjs to your `project.clj` file in the `plugins` section:

```clj
(defproject example "1.0.0"
  :plugins [[lein-lessjs "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]])
```

You need to install Node.js on your machine and less. After you installed Node.js and NPM (which should come with Node.js) issue:

```
npm install -g less
```

You may need to `sudo` that command.


## Configuration

Here is an example of `project.clj` with all the possible definitions.

```clj
(defproject example-project "1.2.3"

  :less {:src ["resources/less/style.less"] ; vector of root less files 
         :output-directory "resources/public/css"
         ;; other options (provided are default values):
         ;; :compress false         ; compress resulting css
         ;; :source-maps true       ; create source maps
         ;; :delete-output-dir true ; remove output directory if empty after deleting the dest files
         }
```


## Usage

To compile your files once:

```sh
$ lein less once
```

To keep the compiler running and watch for changes:

```sh
$ lein less auto
```

To delete all the files generated by lein-lessjs

```
$ lein less clean
```


## Hooks

The following hooks are supported by lein-sass:

```
$ lein compile
$ lein clean
```

To enable the hooks, add the following to your `project.clj` file:

```clj
:hooks [leiningen.less]
```
